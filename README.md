### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan Christopher Johnson. I love watermelon and spending time with family and friends. I love all forms of entertainment and doing anything outdoors, including traveling.

I'm currently doing research in the BYU Immerse Program, primarily on Symbiflow's fpga-tool-perf. I've made 13 Pull Requests and 3 Issues on that page, plus 2 more currently unmerged pull requests.
