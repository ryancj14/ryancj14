### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Christopher Johnson. I'm a senior, studying Computer Engineering and graduating this summer from Brigham Young University. I love watermelon and spending time with family and friends. I love all forms of entertainment and doing anything outdoors, including traveling.

I'm currently a Teaching Assistant in BYU's ECEN Department.

I previously did research in the BYU Immerse Program, primarily on Symbiflow's fpga-tool-perf and other repositories. Last Summer, I made 13 Pull Requests and 3 Issues on that page.
