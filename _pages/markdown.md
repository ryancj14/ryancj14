You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

### Syntax Highlighting

```
```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
'''
```
###### (but that last line is actually ```)
```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

### Tables
Tables are super super handy!!
```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Data | More Data
```
First Header | Second Header

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear crossed out.
```
I want to go ~~home~~ to the park.

## Useful Stuff I've learned:

### Link to another header on your page
```
You should look at the section on [lists](#lists). 
It is super helpful. 
Or just start over from the [top](#markdown).
```

Or just start over from the [top](#markdown).

This works for any header size. Only use one # when referencing it regardless of header size.

When using this, remember to keep the (#link) part lowercase and separate words using - instead of a space:

```
[Right here](#useful-stuff-i've-learned)
```
[Right here](#useful-stuff-i've-learned)

### Images
Images are similar to links to other pages, but with an `!` in front.
