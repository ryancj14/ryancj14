# Combine images and icons into media folder

[https://github.com/byu-cpe/ComputingBootCamp/pull/48](https://github.com/byu-cpe/ComputingBootCamp/pull/48)

In this pull request, I:
1. combined the media folders
2. fixed the references from the pages and other files
3. added a test to ensure that no other media folders are created
4. added a gem to the gemfile so that jekyll will work on mac (this is unrelated to the media changes)
