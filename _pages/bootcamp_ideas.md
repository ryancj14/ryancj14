I'm working with the Bootcamp Broader Impact group this year. This is where I will compile ideas and progress:

---

### Markdown

I will add a 'Getting Started' page on Markdown, just for beginners to have some little help formatting their notes and webpages to look good.
  * [My Previous Markdown Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/markdown.md %})
  * [Markdown Bootcamp Page Progress]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/markdown_bootcamp.md %})

---

### Conda

I will add to the Python packages/environments page, to make it look good, include useful figures, and help the students use conda.
  * [My Previous Conda Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/conda.md %})
  * [Python packages/environments Bootcamp Page Progress]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/conda_bootcamp.md %})
