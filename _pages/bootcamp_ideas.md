# Combine images and icons into media folder

https://github.com/byu-cpe/ComputingBootCamp/pull/48
In this pull request, I:
1. combined the media folders
2. fixed the references from the pages and other files
3. added a test to ensure that no other media folders are created
4. added a gem to the gemfile so that jekyll will work on mac (this is unrelated to the media changes)
Merged on 20 May 2021

# Conda


I will add to the Python packages/environments page, to make it look good, include useful figures, and help the students use conda. I will also look at Symbiflow's make-env to see if I should add anything from there.

# Markdown

I will add a 'Getting Started' page on Markdown, just for beginners to have some little help formatting their notes and webpages to look good.
