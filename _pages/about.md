My name is Ryan Christopher Johnson. I'm a senior, studying Computer Engineering, planning on going to graduate school here at BYU. I love watermelon, entertainment (Books, Movies, Board Games, etc.), and anything outdoors.

I'm a second-year Immerse Student. I'll be working with fpga-tool-perf and other Symbiflow tools this summer. I've made 13 Pull Requests and 3 Issues on that page, plus 2 more currently unmerged pull requests. To see all my contributions to Symbiflow projects from last summer and this summer, go to these pages: [Ryan's Contributions 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contributions2020.md %}) [Ryan's Contributions 2021]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contributions2021.md %})

And finally, I'm getting married this summer on July 24th to Cassie Bean. I'm so excited!
