## From SymbiFlow/ideas

[Issue #50 - Add an .editorconfig file to all SymbiFlow repositories](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/50) -- This seems like a really good first project. It basically entails forking the repository, making a branch, addding a `.editorconfig` file, and making a pull request... for each symbiflow repository. I imagine that the .editorconfig file would be the same for each repo, and that there are people you could reach out to on each repo to test whether it breaks anything and how it would need to be modified. The person would then note each updated repository in the issue.

[Issue #47 - Updated the repositories to comply with the current copyright best practices](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/47) -- There has been much done pertaining to this issue, but there are many unfinished parts that could be easily worked on by undergrad students, in communication with current contributors. It is pretty important to make sure everything is up to date with the copyright best practices so that anyone can use it.

[Issue #53 - Add Contributing Guide to SymbiFlow projects](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/53) -- Currently, only a few projects which constitute SymbiFlow have proper contribution guidelines. Most of them need new guidelines or need to have the existing ones updated. Also, the style and formatting should be unified across all guides.

[Issue #56 - SymbiFlow projects documentation audit](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/56) -- In this task you will perform an audit of documentation in order to verify its completeness, correctness, accuracy and wording. The task will involve close collaboration with developers and engineers to try to anticipate the usersâ€™ questions and issues even before they run into them.

[Issue #7 - Create a JSON schema for the Yosys JSON format](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/7) -- Learn JSON Schema and create one for the jsons created by yosys. Communicate with yosys contributors to know where to add this.

[Issue #52 - Open FPGA for absolute beginners](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/52) -- Gather information and combine it into a guide for newcomers to the world of FPGA chips. After covering the basics, the document would describe the aims of Symbiflow. The Writer would receive guidance, advice, and necessary information from a mentor.

[Issue #54 - Symbiflow ecosystem map](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/54) -- Map providing comprehensive information about the open FPGA ecosystem and the relationships between projects. Could be used in the previous project or coordinate with it.

[Issue #46 - Add common ASIC/FPGA file formats to GitHub/linguist](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/46) -- The student doing this project should reach out to Tim to see if this would be a good contribution they could make. It seems like it should be pretty straightforward and helpful.

[Issue #36 - Improve FASM documentation to boost adoption of the standard](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/36) -- This issue points down to a number of issues in Symbiflow/fasm that need work done on them.

[Issue #8 - Convert yosys documentation to be sphinx compatible](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/8) -- Learn Latex and Sphinx and convert the current documentation from Latex to Sphinx. It seems that this may be done or nearly done. If so, get in touch with Tim in the issue asking if there is anything else that needs to be done or if this can be closed.

## From SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf

[Issue #309 - A single JSON file containing all meta.json data would be useful](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/309) -- This is something that a student would do in python, editing the `exhaust.py` file.

[Issue #281 - Reintroduce all.json to merge all tests results](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/281) -- This one is likely related to the previous issue, so take them both into account and communicate with @acomodi if you work on that.

[Issue #324 - Replace local license checks with the SymbiFlow/actions/checks@main action](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/324) -- Editing something in the .github folder to add to symbiflow/actions/checks.

[Issue #162 - Documentation for each of the designs tested](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/162) -- This would be helpful to record the information specified for each design somewhere in the documentation, or atleast add an example for one design, so that others can pick up with the designs they test.

[Issue #3 - Add support for extracting the VPR "routing information table"](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/3) -- This has been an issue since 2018 and still hasn't been done. It would require intercepting the printed tables in the vpr run and adding them to our printout in fpga-tool-perf

[Issue #22 - Add timeout mechanism](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/fpga-tool-perf/issues/22) -- This has been an issue since 2018 and still hasn't been done. I don't know how this is done, but some research could be done to find out how to implement it.

## From SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples

[Issue #139 - Documentation: checkout of symbiflow-examples should be part of Installation part](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/139) -- Updating documentation. Not sure exactly what is wanted here, but you'll figure it out if you look into the related issue and dcoumentation.

[Issue #56 - Add Music box example from FPGA4Fun to symbiflow-examples](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/56) -- I don't know exactly the process to add this, but with communication with Tim, you could take this project on.

[Issue #57 - Add all fpga4fun - "FPGA projects - Basic" examples to repository](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/57) -- This would be a continuation of the previous project, adding the rest of the FPGA4Fun examples.

[Issue #59 - Redundant conda download when doing 'make README.rst'](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/59) -- Add the stuff from make README.rst to make env and make any other requested changes here.

[Issue #38 - Convert the README docs to rst and make sure it is included in symbiflow.rtfd.io](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/38) -- Study the symbiflow-examples documentation and communicate with Tim for direction on this project.

[Issue #95 - Improve the quality of images in the sphinx-based documentation](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-examples/issues/95) -- Improve the Spinx documentation, including the images.

## From SymbiFlow/symbiflow-rr-graph

[Issue #12 - Add linting and formatting checking](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-rr-graph/issues/12) -- This would mean looking at other repos to see how they handle formatting in make format and adding that to this repo. One would need to download the repo and understand exactly what needed formatting.

[Issue #7 - Get documentation up on ReadTheDocs](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-rr-graph/issues/7) -- While I haven't worked on ReadTheDocs documentation before, I think it wouldn't be hard to approach and learn, and then work with collaborators on the best documentation.

## Other Ideas

All project managers seem to have in common a desire for better and more streamlined and uniform documentation. Adding to a project's documentation or creating it is a good idea. Make sure it is in the right format and the right place and has all the necessary and relevant information.
