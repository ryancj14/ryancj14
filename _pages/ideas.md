## From Symbiflow/ideas

[Issue #14 - Package all of Symbiflow dependencies into a conda repository](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/14) -- This is a potential project if a student knew conda really well, packaging all of the symbiflow dependencies into a single conda repository. One would need to reach out to Tim for a better understanding of what is needed here.

[Issue #52 - Open FPGA for absolute beginners](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/52) -- Gather information and combine it into a guide for newcomers to the world of FPGA chips. After covering the basics, the document would describe the aims of Symbiflow. The Writer would receive guidance, advice, and necessary information from a mentor.

[Issue #54 - Symbiflow ecosystem map](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/54) -- Map providing comprehensive information about the open FPGA ecosystem and the relationships between projects. Could be used in the previous project or coordinate with it.

[Issue #56 - SymbiFlow projects documentation audit](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/56) -- In this task you will perform an audit of documentation in order to verify its completeness, correctness, accuracy and wording. The task will involve close collaboration with developers and engineers to try to anticipate the usersâ€™ questions and issues even before they run into them.

[Issue #53 - Add Contributing Guide to SymbiFlow projects](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/53) -- Currently, only a few projects which constitute SymbiFlow have proper contribution guidelines. Most of them need new guidelines or need to have the existing ones updated. Also, the style and formatting should be unified across all guides.

## Other Ideas

All project managers seem to have in common a desire for better and more streamlined and uniform documentation. Adding to a project's documentation or creating it is a good idea. Make sure it is in the right format and the right place and has all the necessary and relevant information.
