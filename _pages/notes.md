# common configuration git repository

This project is related to Symbiflow ideas Issue #51 and others to add lots of 
[Issue #51 - ](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/51) --

This issue is a compilation of issues #50, #49, and other needed additions into one idea issue.
[Issue #50 - Add an .editorconfig file to all SymbiFlow repositories](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/50) 
[Issue #49 - Create a symbiflow-sphinx-docs-common repository](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/49) 

Steps:
* Add a comment on issue #51, and tag Tim
  * My Comment: @mithro This seems like a project we could take on here at BYU. We would start a reasonably new student on it. Our idea is that we will create a new repo that will serve as a container for the items on your checklist, and start our student on adding items to the repo. This project would continue throughout the summer, and anything that isn't done by our student could be added by other SymbiFlow contributors in the future. Our student would probably start by adding the .editorconfig file and some 'documentation around policies' items. Do you think this will be useful? Do you have any other thoughts/direction for us?
